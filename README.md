sly-company [DEPRECATED]
========================

**This used to be** a [company-mode](http://company-mode.github.io)
Emacs completion backend for
[SLY](https://github.com/capitaomorte/sly), a Common Lisp IDE.

**Nowadays**, with a recent SLY, you don't need it.  Just `M-x
global-company-mode` should get you `company`-style completion in
emacs, i.e. it should get you something like this:

### Credit

[company-mode](http://company-mode.github.io) is a completion
framework Nikolaj Schumacher. sly-company was based on
